I will set up a room with Kim.&#10;&#10;Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:&#10;&#10;1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, &#10;TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the &#10; parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and &#10;TAGG but the issues facing &#10; scheduling in Unify are grey.&#10;&#10;2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up" &#10;policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need &#10;further scrutiny.&#10;&#10;3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical &#10;imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?&#10;&#10;4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training &#10;courses, review progress and make cuts.&#10;&#10;5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at &#10;everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add &#10; some value and direction to the group.&#10;&#10;&#10;In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD &#10;to work part time to get it done.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Their version includes the salary of a &#10;superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third &#10;party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of "construction management" &#10;fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be &#10;paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally &#10;the builders profit of 1.4 million.&#10;&#10;Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out &#10;of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if &#10;they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? &#10;We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition &#10;to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been &#10;in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and &#10;the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management &#10;fee is included.&#10;&#10;George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will &#10;review and let you know what I think.&#10;&#10;The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to &#10;the 3 out 4 approval process.&#10;&#10;Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only &#10;true costs + 1.4 million.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Sorry it is so late.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.&#10;&#10;1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank &#10;is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the &#10;spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.&#10;&#10;2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?&#10;&#10;3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?&#10;&#10;4. #11 Missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;5. #13 Missed on 1/26?&#10;&#10;6. #14 missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?&#10;&#10;8. #20a missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;9. #35 missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. &#10;You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on &#10;some of these.

Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate&#10;&#10;2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million&#10;&#10;3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.&#10;&#10;4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?&#10;&#10;5. 60/40 split favoring the investors.&#10;&#10;With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a &#10;solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes &#10;costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I &#10;would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax &#10;all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the &#10;checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing &#10;but invoices were not being submitted.&#10;&#10;Let me know if you can draft these agreements. The GP issue may need some &#10;tweaking. &#10;&#10;Phillip Allen&#10;713-853-7041&#10;pallen@enron.com&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

There are several &#10;reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the &#10;large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer &#10;are the three biggest concerns. &#10;&#10;What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the &#10;buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due &#10;until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the &#10;property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make &#10;the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance &#10;is pushing too far.&#10;&#10;Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the &#10;earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?&#10;&#10;Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

It &#10;is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move &#10;in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I &#10;realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and &#10;your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be &#10;working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running &#10;an errand for the property.&#10;&#10;I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this &#10;time. We can look at again later in the year.&#10;&#10;I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

I have shifted &#10;to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could &#10;not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more &#10;towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One &#10;wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 &#10;kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + &#10;guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This &#10;plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the &#10;courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor &#10;living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. &#10; The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass &#10;skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have &#10;single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. &#10;&#10;I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would &#10;like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I &#10;would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I &#10;would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we &#10;didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. &#10;&#10;Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. &#10;pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)&#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip Allen&#10;&#10;&#10;PS.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and &#10;repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor &#10;cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on &#10;repairs.&#10;&#10;2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite &#10;manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has &#10;interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager &#10;that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a &#10;management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager &#10;onsite.&#10;&#10;3. Considering #1 &amp; #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you &#10;want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.&#10;&#10;4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure &#10;this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below.&#10;&#10;My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property &#10;definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sales Price 705,000&#10;&#10;1st Lien 473,500&#10;&#10;2nd Lien 225,000&#10;&#10;Transfer fee 7,500&#10;&#10;Cash required 14,500&#10;&#10;&#10;NOI 100,000&#10;&#10;1st Lien 47,292&#10;&#10;2nd Lien 23,694&#10;&#10;Cash flow 29,014&#10;&#10;Cash on cash 200%&#10;&#10;&#10;These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then &#10;cash on cash return would be more like 300%. This doesn't reflect the &#10;additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years &#10;for a higher price.&#10;&#10;Do you want to reconsider? Let me know.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be &#10;recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would &#10;be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the &#10;investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned &#10;earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as &#10;part of the construction contract. &#10;&#10;Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look &#10;like here are a few ideas:&#10;&#10; 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from &#10;higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.&#10;&#10; 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase &#10;1 complete in November)&#10; +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule&#10; -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule&#10;&#10;This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but &#10;could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule &#10;must be discussed and agreed upon.&#10;&#10;Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626&#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10; &#10; &#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially &#10;complete. PG&amp;E is OK with the docs. All QFs but Calpine have agreed with &#10;the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&amp;E would "retain" $106 million (of &#10;what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&amp;E from QFs who &#10;switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the &#10;QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December &#10;(and maybe earlier).&#10;&#10;PG&amp;E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the &#10;Force Majeure notices off the table.

Note that the&#10;construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our&#10;standard rate of 10%. This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio&#10;of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.&#10;&#10;Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs&#10;are high. Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have&#10;actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf&#10;without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.&#10;&#10;It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. However, I am fairly&#10;sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.&#10;&#10;I hope to finish the proforma today. The rental rates that we project are&#10;$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3&#10;bedroom. Additional revenues could be generated by building detached&#10;garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; - winmail.dat&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

One for $150 and the other &#10;for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13?&#10;&#10; Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For &#10;what periods?&#10;&#10; &#10;What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! &#10;That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money &#10;and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first &#10;asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like &#10;leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the &#10;apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly &#10;inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has &#10;been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.&#10;&#10;I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so &#10;I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this &#10;right? Has the deposit been made yet?&#10;&#10;&#10; A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.&#10;&#10;Phillip</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

In attendance were Ken Lay, &#10;the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. The gov. &#10;spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his &#10;ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next &#10;week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. &#10;Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on &#10;my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff &#10;Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our &#10;proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation &#10;based on the governor's comments:&#10;&#10;Overview: We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that &#10;we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing &#10;communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to &#10;go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what &#10;the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. His staff has more &#10;work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He &#10;talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail &#10;level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the &#10;benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he &#10;would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power &#10;(which he estimates at 3000MW). He foresees a mix of market oriented &#10;solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix &#10;the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.&#10;Our proposals: I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also &#10;included the forward price information several of you provided). He seemed &#10;interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a &#10;goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities &#10;to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate &#10;analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues &#10;including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. &#10;He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas &#10;purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding &#10;some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.&#10;His ideas: The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously &#10;under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". &#10;Some of these ideas would require legislative action.&#10;State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of &#10;generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that &#10;they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This &#10;was a frequently recurring theme.&#10;Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus &#10;basis to consumers.&#10;Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in &#10;California.&#10;State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more &#10;widely deploy distributed generation.&#10;Expand in-state gas production.&#10;Take state lands gas royalties in kind.&#10;negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for &#10;addtional gas supplies.&#10;Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant &#10;maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at &#10;any one time.&#10;Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.&#10;Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear &#10;more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be &#10;able to help out here).&#10;Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. We made &#10;some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy &#10;some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation &#10;thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control &#10;approach with generators.&#10;Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.&#10;To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's &#10;thoughts and get them to Kari)&#10;He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- &#10;not just the 5 one year strips.&#10;He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.&#10;He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the &#10;deal.&#10;He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the &#10;forward contracting issues.&#10;Thanks to everyone for their help. We made some progress today.&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

If &#10;you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As far as recommendations, here is a short list:&#10;&#10; 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales &#10;above monthly index without enough consideration of future &#10; replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be &#10;injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.&#10; This creates a shortage in later months.&#10;&#10; 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet &#10;demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. &#10; Specific questions should include: &#10;&#10; 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order &#10;to fill storage?&#10;&#10; 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too &#10;much gas from Socal's system. &#10; I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their &#10;own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than &#10;their injection capablity, but injected far less.&#10;&#10; 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short &#10;term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major &#10; LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating &#10;rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market &#10;and the &#10; consumer has benefitted. &#10;&#10;&#10;Call me if you need any more input.&#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I &#10;want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may &#10;not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team &#10;have requested our involvement with. I also want to make sure I'm bringing &#10;resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.&#10;&#10;For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent &#10;developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received &#10;from the NYC office re: Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, &#10;where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be &#10;with one of their medical groups based in Chicago. After several &#10;unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant &#10;category. Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement &#10;with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and &#10;today American Express has surfaced. Consequently, I think it's probably a &#10;good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you. &#10;&#10;I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would &#10;work? If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any &#10;time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th. When would be good for you? Please &#10;let me know!&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

This is from one of &#10;the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot &#10;of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I &#10;found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no &#10;minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the &#10;lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.&#10;&#10;Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on &#10;what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And &#10;when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the &#10;information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the &#10;big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest &#10;individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.&#10;&#10;JF&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.&#10;&#10;+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the &#10;perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no &#10;industrial (basic industry type) can operate. He tracks all the plant &#10;closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a &#10;more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track &#10;this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic &#10;conditions- like recession!!). I will try to find out what his total number &#10;for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does &#10;not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for &#10;the summer.&#10;&#10;While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels&#10;He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) &#10;based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally &#10;think that 1Q02 sees little. I know that the fundamentals group is tracking &#10;these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q &#10;over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.&#10;&#10;He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, &#10;crude/propane....&#10;&#10;+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 &#10;storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the &#10;backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower &#10;baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue. I am torn &#10;on this one.&#10;&#10;+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same &#10;analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long &#10;nat gas!! through vol or outright.&#10;&#10;+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas &#10;just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM &#10;issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. &#10;&#10;+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: &#10;Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance &#10;(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, &#10;I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.&#10;&#10;Have a great holiday! I'll be here next week.&#10;&#10;Caroline&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Also I hope your holliday &#10;season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)&#10; Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I &#10;suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, &#10;Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he &#10;should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. &#10;Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a &#10;large role in turning the crude and products group around. &#10;&#10; Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of &#10;good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the &#10;gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products &#10;(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods.

Then it saw a better&#10;deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting&#10;unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is&#10;selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it&#10;pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.&#10;It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in&#10;energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even&#10;oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or&#10;natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large&#10;industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --&#10;will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they&#10;also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum&#10;and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to&#10;consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.&#10;"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know&#10;what they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chief&#10;economist at Standard &amp; Poor's. Some economists have recently increased&#10;their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on&#10;an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated&#10;that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a&#10;typical U.S. household.&#10;That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher&#10;energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected&#10;growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual&#10;rate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energy&#10;price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic&#10;slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in&#10;Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use&#10;natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the&#10;company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in&#10;December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,&#10;which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its&#10;existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative&#10;officer.&#10;"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.&#10;Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but&#10;Rosenbury said it would be "substantial." In coming months, Terra's good&#10;fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the&#10;prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even&#10;point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate&#10;the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"&#10;Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."&#10;He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18&#10;million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating&#10;now. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that&#10;farmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark&#10;Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and&#10;distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,&#10;indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next&#10;month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify&#10;continued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble&#10;[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to&#10;buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said Paul&#10;M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A&#10;continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and&#10;raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to&#10;plant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."&#10;According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas&#10;remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --&#10;farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the&#10;aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the&#10;industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an&#10;analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond.&#10;Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,&#10;and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get more&#10;production cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. and&#10;world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum&#10;supplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then&#10;[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more&#10;than the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question&#10;how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually&#10;entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,&#10;says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville&#10;for $550 a megawatt hour for December.&#10;But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future&#10;profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,&#10;to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to&#10;Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and&#10;Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after&#10;next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries&#10;to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Out&#10;here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an&#10;ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live&#10;up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Mosey&#10;said.&#10;, 2000 The Washington Post Company&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Perhaps &#10;surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and &#10;gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. &#10;Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 &#10;kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold &#10;weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well &#10;above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur &#10;material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. &#10;However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.&#10;Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not &#10;the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? &#10;Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. &#10;Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.&#10;Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly &#10;high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Per your &#10;request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business &#10;partners was e-mailed to you this morning.&#10;&#10;HP contacts to date: &#10;&#10;Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager&#10;Houston, TX&#10;#(713)-439-5587&#10;(Gerry Cashiola's boss)&#10;&#10;Gerry Cashiola, sales representative &#10;Houston, TX&#10;#(713)-439-5555&#10;(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)&#10;&#10;Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager&#10;Southeast Region&#10;Austin, TX &#10;(#(512)-257-5735&#10;(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer &#10;leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)&#10;&#10;Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances&#10;Austin, TX&#10;#(512)-257-5736&#10;(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)&#10;&#10;Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions&#10;Cupertino, CA&#10;#(408)-447-5240&#10;(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business &#10;propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value &#10;propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the &#10;11/16th meeting)&#10;&#10;Matt,&#10; &#10;On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's &#10;trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit &#10;center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, &#10;held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's &#10;products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron &#10;(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).&#10;&#10;On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark &#10;outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and &#10;wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:&#10;&#10;1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola &#10;has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this &#10;information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short &#10;term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term?&#10;&#10;2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to &#10;explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)&#10;&#10;3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT &#10;Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) &#10;&#10;In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several &#10;decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:&#10;&#10;&#10;Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More &#10;importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews &#10;of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the &#10;GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been &#10;unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between &#10;Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has &#10;remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior &#10;level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship &#10;forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this &#10;strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But &#10;Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, &#10;rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the &#10;relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and &#10;Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central &#10;Region.&#10;&#10; In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding &#10;wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS &#10;initiative by reiterating the following two points: &#10;&#10; a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on &#10;the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only &#10;some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)&#10;&#10; b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's &#10;business relationship process with Enron&#10;&#10; Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill &#10;Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in &#10;the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer &#10;in person. &#10;&#10;&#10;We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and &#10;other opportunities. &#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy Hunter&#10;Enron Corporation&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing - Business Development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer &#10;in person. &#10;&#10;&#10;We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and &#10;other opportunities. &#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy Hunter&#10;Enron Corporation&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing - Business Development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Basically, the testing is not fully &#10;completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is &#10;also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the &#10;purchase decision). As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out &#10;on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas. &#10;However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to &#10;surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.&#10;&#10;In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with &#10;the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at &#10;EBS. The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema &#10;Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, &#10;especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation. &#10;&#10;Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential &#10;vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC &#10;purchase at this point. I will be on vacation next week, but will be &#10;checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th. Jennifer or I will keep &#10;you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.&#10;&#10;I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to &#10;me. The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net &#10;Works teams in question: more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales &#10;opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your &#10;deal done. The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from &#10;yesterday still apply.&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 12/15/2000 05:15 PM -----&#10;&#10; Douglas Cummins@ECT&#10; 12/15/2000 04:14 PM&#10; &#10; To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: Re: BMC Summary to-date&#10;&#10;Jeff,&#10;&#10;We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's &#10;solution is a better one for us.&#10;&#10;My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent &#10;product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase.

Everett, I am asking for your input as &#10;it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the &#10;relationship owners. During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :&#10; a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately &#10;(his replacement has yet to be named). My perception is that Keith took the &#10;hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales &#10;projections. EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected &#10;targets. &#10; b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his &#10;existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server &#10;Agreement &#10; c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS &#10;Services. For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed &#10;at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an &#10;8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters. EBS sent &#10;Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th. Compaq has not paid the &#10;invoice. Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying &#10;Compaq. Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay. Bob stated that &#10;EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and &#10;Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS &#10;services (Bob's first negotiation position). &#10; d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in &#10;the EBS Server Spend amount. &#10; Compaq (Bob Jordan) value - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and &#10;hardware in 2000&#10; EBS (added) - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million &#10;for servers and hardware in 2000&#10; EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in &#10;1999&#10; EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional &#10;services (costs for Server deployment)&#10;&#10; From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the &#10;following might occur&#10; EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000 at 8% would equal a Compaq &#10;purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)&#10; Compaq total is $5.1 million spend at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase &#10;amount of $408,000&#10; EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount &#10;is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) &#10;&#10; e) 2000 income. Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had &#10;to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could &#10;defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, &#10;2002. If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the &#10;right to spend against the amount. To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS &#10;worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS &#10;consulting services provided to Compaq. Again, under Keith M's stewardship &#10;- they verbally agreed to pay. &#10;&#10;Now with the above information - my offered next steps :&#10; a) Until everything is done - maintain the "stick" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 &#10;million). This is being done.&#10; b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee. It &#10;does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages. Prior &#10;conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee &#10;(again with Keith M). This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. &#10; c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on &#10;services of $4.1 million. This is a good return for a commodity &#10;transaction. So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier &#10;relationship. &#10;&#10; So...... please let me know your thougths. We have countered with the $2.5 &#10;million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000. &#10;&#10;Please let me know your thoughts&#10;&#10;Kim Godfrey&#10;Director, Enterprise Services&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

We would &#10;appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;&#10;Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year &#10;with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic &#10;Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader, to review the strong &#10;business relationship in fuel management and travel services which Enron has &#10;had with Continental Airlines. Discussions were held as to how this &#10;relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.&#10;&#10;A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both &#10;companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to &#10;expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in &#10;weather derivatives and plastics hedging.&#10;&#10;December 11th Meeting Purpose: Follow-up from October 25th meeting to &#10;specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th &#10;meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude: (1) fuel management, &#10;(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.&#10;&#10;Location: Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his &#10;availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor. If he can make it for &#10;a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he &#10;is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 &#10;Smith Street. Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific &#10;preference?&#10;&#10;Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:&#10;&#10;Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services&#10;Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer&#10;Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company&#10;Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)&#10;&#10;Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, &#10;we have coordinated through John Nowlan. At the October 25th meeting, Alan &#10;Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather &#10;derivatives opportunities, respectively. &#10;&#10;Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines Enron's &#10;current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed &#10;initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging. Larry &#10;Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing &#10;input on this.&#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy Hunter&#10;Enron Corporation&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing -- Business Development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities &#10;(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together. &#10;After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin &#10;as the point person for these communications. EBS had prior direction from &#10;Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith &#10;McAuliffe or Kent Major. Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending &#10;additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business &#10;opportunities and issues. &#10;&#10;EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop &#10;the streaming media server solutions. We discussed during the Dec 14th &#10;meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product &#10;and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media &#10;solutions. EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the &#10;intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these &#10;solutions. To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the &#10;appropriate next steps to further our relationship. &#10;&#10;The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework &#10;for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change. Until &#10;those changes are made:&#10;1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services: Per the Agreement, Compaq &#10;was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November &#10;7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Compaq had agreed to the invoice &#10;amount. EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 &#10;on or before December 31,2000. &#10;2) Potential for Agreement Termination: Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, &#10;Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself). &#10;The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written &#10;notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000. The concept to start over with a &#10;new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting. &#10;EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if &#10;Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we &#10;look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal. &#10;&#10;Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create &#10;strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq. &#10;&#10;Kim Godfrey&#10;Director, Enterprise Services&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Munson expressed that during &#10;their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have &#10;attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has &#10;with regard to selection/use of BMC's products. Bernie voiced that he hasn't &#10;been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net &#10;Works has, beyond what you and I know. The BMC account team feels that &#10;without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely &#10;fashion.&#10;&#10;The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are &#10;not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and &#10;not in writing). Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the &#10;(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) "...haven't &#10;kept up with the industry", and that they (Net Works) have some residual &#10;issues with the BMC account support in general. Bottom Line, expressed by &#10;Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC &#10;software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.&#10;&#10;You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification &#10;and liquidated damages clauses being implemented. Jennifer and I discussed &#10;this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context. We have a &#10;possible alternative for you to consider: perhaps EBS might provide a hedge &#10;for Net Works in the form of "advance purchase" of BMC product.&#10;&#10;For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but &#10;needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total &#10;Enron purchases from BMC. A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark &#10;with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC &#10;time to "click" might be this: EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC &#10;software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other &#10;$2 million is used as a "future purchases" fund, in which EBS buys, but does &#10;not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current &#10;software...&#10;&#10;THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of &#10;BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is &#10;delivered from/by BMC. That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other &#10;business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they &#10;seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product &#10;when they need it in the future). In addition, you secure the business with &#10;BMC right now. I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the &#10;time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to &#10;you.&#10;&#10;If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the &#10;meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on &#10;progress.&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

It builds on &#10;Offset to Last Trade functionality.&#10;&#10;The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and &#10;Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis). As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. &#10;As Bias increases, the Offset increases.&#10;&#10;I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.&#10;&#10;Dave&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;Program Criteria&#10;&#10;The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to &#10;work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:&#10;&#10;Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless &#10;of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last &#10;[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction &#10;Tibco messages for the Product.&#10;Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction &#10;flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.&#10;Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving &#10;average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].&#10;#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.&#10;#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.&#10;Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}&#10;Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.&#10;Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.&#10;Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be &#10;reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy &#10;occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the &#10;ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.&#10;Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be &#10;reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy &#10;occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the &#10;TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal &#10;to 1.&#10;Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this &#10;might be [0.04]&#10;Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this &#10;might be [0.50]&#10;Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A &#10;possible value for this might be [0].&#10;Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A &#10;possible value for this might be [0.50]&#10;Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started&#10;Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started&#10;Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed &#10;Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A &#10;possible value for this might be [0.01]&#10;Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will &#10;recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during &#10;the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.&#10;&#10;Program Outputs&#10;&#10;The program should output the following variables as a result of combining &#10;the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:&#10;&#10;Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager&#10;Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager&#10;Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. &#10;Normally "False"&#10;&#10;&#10;Program Interface and Operation Principles&#10;&#10;The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a &#10;relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the &#10;Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with &#10;Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. &#10;&#10;Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will &#10;be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the &#10;program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, &#10;then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and &#10;Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. &#10;&#10;If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread &#10;should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) &#10;or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the &#10;system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last &#10;transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread &#10;value.&#10;&#10;Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a &#10;reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the &#10;Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced &#10;accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula &#10;to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain &#10;the Spread-Offset Minimum.&#10;&#10;GUI/Formulas Example:&#10;&#10;Constants&#10;Intensity Factor: [4]&#10;Dead Interval: [240]&#10;Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]&#10;Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]&#10;Spread Minimum [0.04]&#10;Spread Maximum [0.50]&#10;Offset Minimum [0]&#10;Offset Maximum [0.49]&#10;Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]&#10;&#10; INPUTS OUTPUTS&#10;Intensity Formula&#10;Formula # Intensity Spread Offset Suspension&#10;S1 &gt;220 -0.01 n/a F&#10;S2 &lt;30 +0.01 n/a F&#10;S3 &lt;10 +0.02 n/a F&#10;&#10;Transaction Formula&#10;Formula # # Transactions Spread Offset Suspension&#10;V1 &lt;4 n/a -0.01 F&#10;V2 &gt;3 n/a +0.01 F&#10;V3 &gt;5 +0.01 +0.02 F&#10;V4 &gt;10 +0.02 +0.04 F&#10;V5 &gt;15 +0.04 +0.15 F&#10;V6 &gt;20 n/a n/a T&#10; &#10;Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also &#10;that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather &#10;are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently &#10;occured.&#10;&#10;In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through &#10;the GUI.&#10;&#10;&#10;Simulation&#10;&#10;Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations &#10;to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of &#10;how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular &#10;direction, please see the attached:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Additional Features&#10;&#10;System Notifications&#10;&#10;There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be &#10;similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both &#10;Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The &#10;Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be &#10;automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the &#10;trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both &#10;maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The &#10;notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). &#10;Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Dave&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas &#10;(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&amp;E has &#10;one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. &#10;Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are &#10;about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic &#10;feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said &#10;yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the &#10;pipeline system in California. &#10;&#10;This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG &#10;consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that &#10;he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested &#10;in looking further into transporting LNG into California. &#10;&#10;Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there &#10;are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:&#10;&#10;Location Owner Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day) Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage &#10;(gal) Storage (mmcf)&#10;Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000 7.4 100,000 8.2&#10;LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000 1.64 100,000 8.2&#10;Sacramento 57,600 4.72 132,000 10.8&#10;LaBarge, WY Exxon 60,000 4.92 &#10;Evanston, WY Amoco 95,000 7.8 100,000 8.2&#10;&#10;Totals 26.48&#10;&#10;Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The &#10;Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to &#10;providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with &#10;LNG fleet owners. &#10;&#10;I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. </body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing &#10;plants for instance. switching is significant and has led to cash in the &#10;gulf expiring weak everyday. gas daily spread to prompt trading at &#10;$1....need some very cold weather to justify that. this seems to be the test &#10;of the next 3-5 days. Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management &#10;keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too &#10;many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub. unless we get some crazy &#10;prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market. &#10;&#10;funny watching the flies in the front. Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 &#10;friday morning. probably worth 1.30 now. crazy. people have seen each &#10;front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h. &#10;&#10;what's the thoughts on distillates... is it tight enough such that gas &#10;switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market &#10;too oversupplied to care?</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

There are a &#10;couple of reasons for this. &#10;&#10;First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only &#10;two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, &#10;affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military &#10;and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG &#10;Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck &#10;fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I &#10;was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is &#10;operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and &#10;Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern &#10;California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by &#10;ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and &#10;subsequent loading onto trucks.&#10;&#10;Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The &#10;average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into &#10;820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could &#10;deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely &#10;transfer it into storage. &#10;&#10;The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would &#10;be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under &#10;repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 &#10;mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a &#10;time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, &#10;ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some &#10;reason. &#10;&#10;I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. &#10;I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located &#10;peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. &#10;&#10;Please let me know if you have specific questions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

To answer your question: It is looking &#10;more and more like the week of January 8th. The meetings would be held using &#10;approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window: the 9th, 10th, and 11th. I have &#10;input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a &#10;tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th. &#10;&#10;I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) &#10;which each would be attending. For example, you would probably attend both &#10;days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day &#10;meetings. I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. &#10;certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems &#10;Engineer(s).&#10;&#10;I will call you this week to get your input re: who from your team would be &#10;going, and for which days.&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Larry Ciscon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS&#10; 11/27/2000 08:31 PM&#10; &#10; To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: RE: Enron / Avaya meetings: calendar&#10;&#10;Jeff,&#10;&#10;What's the current plan on this meeting?

If Larry and Everett &#10;can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in &#10;for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.&#10;&#10;Larry,&#10;&#10;I have left you a voicemail, and this note.

Thank you. &#10;&#10;&#10;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip: the first day (only) &#10;is for executives to investigate the following items --&#10;1) what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal &#10;use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.) EBS sell &#10;EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use&#10;2) ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into &#10;a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type &#10;of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined. EBS sell with, &#10;and/or through the Avaya sales organization&#10;&#10;&#10;The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS &#10;development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: &#10;1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&amp;2 above, &#10;discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues &#10;and opportunities&#10;and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which &#10;could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions &#10; to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &amp; &#10;marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both &#10;days due to the nature of his mission.&#10;&#10;&#10;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;Please let me know as soon as you can which day or &#10;days would work best for you to make the trip. I need to &#10;get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so &#10;he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing &#10;center facility.&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716&#10;----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 11/21/2000 03:56 PM -----&#10;&#10; Jeff Youngflesh&#10; 11/21/2000 10:44 AM&#10; &#10; To: thadwhite@avaya.com&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: RE: Enron / Avaya meetings in Basking Ridge&#10;&#10;Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the &#10;people scheduled?

Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as &#10;wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. &#10;Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it &#10;couldn't do it this year....&#10;A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve &#10;told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than &#10;is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an &#10;Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling &#10;it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, &#10;cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage &#10;economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of &#10;winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. &#10;Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys &#10;are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it &#10;going to zero?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM&#10;To: John.Arnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: re:mkts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up &#10;buying&#10;em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month&#10;&#10;fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time &#10;is&#10;busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with&#10;calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have &#10;the&#10;time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but&#10;one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called &#10;impact&#10;of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate &#10;at&#10;all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.&#10; also will be curious how these "loan deals" by pipes work ouut. man these&#10;guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash&#10;hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in &#10;the&#10;back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep&#10;that part of the curve very strong agree?&#10; be cool my man-talk later&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Spreads definitely &#10;implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. &#10;Hell, already seeing it in the West. The system is just broken there. &#10;interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. &#10;definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until &#10;latter part of the winter. the inelasticity of demand continues to be &#10;unbelievable. who would have thunk it. Gas can be 3 times what it was one &#10;year ago and not a significant loss of demand. &#10;market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point. continues to be a &#10;very trending market. most days finish on the intraday high or low. &#10;Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been &#10;significant. i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day. understand they &#10;are changing their view somewhat tomorrow. wait and see if it relieves some &#10;back pressure. very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 &#10;considering the scenario that's being painted. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM&#10;To: jarnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: re:mkts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for&#10;me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled &#10;all&#10;the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas&#10;therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was &#10;long&#10;mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early&#10; flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a&#10;flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained&#10;aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.&#10;&#10; but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to &#10;mark&#10;silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no&#10;idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. &#10;any&#10;great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.&#10; guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling &#10;dry&#10;up??&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

I would like to forward this on to James &#10;Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and &#10;cc Mike Rabon). Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it &#10;overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary &#10;King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?&#10;&#10;Thanks for your suggestion! SJ&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Thompson:&#10;&#10;Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband &#10;Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate &#10;broadband solutions architect at Kinko's. You may recall having met Mike &#10;Rabon in the October 6th meeting. &#10;&#10;Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches. Kinko's had &#10;expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to &#10;it in the spring 2001 time frame. Enron's goal would be to make a needs &#10;assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it &#10;pertains to:&#10;Near term network planning.&#10;IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.&#10;IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet &#10;transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit &#10;capacity.&#10;Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for &#10;managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy &#10;storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about &#10;your storage strategy and growth.&#10;Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the &#10;actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the &#10;hubs.&#10;Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality &#10;H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron &#10;IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be &#10;significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality. Enron's &#10;utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic &#10;and video traffic to traverse the same network. Mike Rabon would like to &#10;speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.&#10;Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be &#10;communicated to the proper person.&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November &#10;8th, 2000. It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and &#10;Q86409.4. These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore &#10;count as a total of four deals. &#10;&#10;We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as &#10;just one large deal with 4 different parts. Unfortunately, the EOL &#10;Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals &#10;are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal. Since this &#10;currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most &#10;conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals. This results &#10;in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.&#10;&#10;If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.&#10;&#10;Pete Berzins&#10;x57597&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to &#10;choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the &#10;western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in &#10;NJ. Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th &#10;of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week. &#10;&#10;However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I &#10;need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' &#10;availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The &#10;meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for &#10;the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of &#10;meeting time for the executives (VP &amp; up, primarily) to discuss possible &#10;alignments and opportunities. This would include two primary areas:&#10;&#10;1) EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use: what types of potential &#10;solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and&#10;2) EBS &amp; Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to &#10;determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the &#10;(common) markets served: "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" &#10;(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as &#10;sales channels for each other's sales forces.&#10;&#10;These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would &#10;include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss &#10;areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value &#10;propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a &#10;go-to-market effort (item #2, above). In addition, the technical aspects of &#10;some of the &#10;"EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item &#10;#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be &#10;addressed.&#10;&#10;Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for &#10;your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to &#10;Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days &#10;synchronized with your executives'. &#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

We actually had a conversition over the phone. I &#10;also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything &#10;from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this &#10;browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their &#10;PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really &#10;not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is &#10;ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. &#10;&#10;Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard &#10;application. &#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Fangming&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Period.&#10;&#10;7) The Result: EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net &#10;Works' folks are concerned.&#10;&#10;In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a &#10;heads-up re: possible fallout around the BMC thing. I told George in this &#10;morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I &#10;don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and &#10;implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business &#10;unit could access, etc. I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were &#10;likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended &#10;against). George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub. &#10;&#10;If you have any questions, please let me know.&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 12/04/2000 10:32 AM -----&#10;&#10; Stephen Morse@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS&#10; 12/04/2000 10:04 AM&#10; &#10; To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: Jennifer N Stewart/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; Subject: FW: Win2K Certification&#10;&#10;FYI,&#10;&#10;Pls see note below from BMC Sales folks.&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Steve&#10;&#10;&#10;Steve Morse&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;713-853-7137-work&#10;713-569-7912-cell&#10;email: stephen_morse@enron.net&#10;----- Forwarded by Stephen Morse/Enron Communications on 12/04/00 10:07 AM &#10;-----&#10;&#10; Ann_Munson@bmc.com&#10; 11/22/00 11:54 AM&#10; &#10; To: Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications&#10; cc: Chaz Vaughan/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Joe_Young@bmc.com&#10; Subject: FW: Win2K Certification&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Here's the latest communication to Bruce Smith regarding Control-SA and&#10;Control-M Windows 2000 certification, as well as reporting on the testing.&#10;It's in the document, but to point it out, Control-SA is ready for&#10;certification process on Dec of 2000 and Control-M on March 2001.&#10;&#10;Ann M.

We have also summarized our Windows 2000 development and&#10;&gt; certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach. The&#10;&gt; most critical phase, which ensures Win2K compatibility and support and&#10;&gt; includes customer testing, has been completed. The Win2K Agents are GA&#10;&gt; for both Control-M (scheduling) and Control-SA (security).&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; The next phase, which is also a key element of our development strategy,&#10;&gt; is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for&#10;&gt; Microsoft Win2K. This phase follows the Win2K initial release as MS&#10;&gt; Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the&#10;&gt; application's functionality - ability to work correctly in the Control-M&#10;&gt; environment.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of&#10;&gt; the application. It is my understanding that one of the reasons Control-M&#10;&gt; is being considered as a replacement for sys*Admiral is due to the&#10;&gt; problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMC's Win2K&#10;&gt; Development Plans. Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with&#10;&gt; an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more&#10;&gt; detail?&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; One final note. I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves,&#10;&gt; reconfirming that Control-M continues to run smoothly since we made the&#10;&gt; database changes.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week. It seems as we have&#10;&gt; finally got this thing running smoothly. After extending the database and&#10;&gt; troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out&#10;&gt; hearts content.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Please tell Ronnie thanks for all his help as well&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Thanks Again&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rusty&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; As a next step, could we meet soon after the Thanksgiving Holidays?

It now appears that most of the problems were caused by the&#10;&gt; setup&#10;&gt; of the Oracle database.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Once we left Thursday evening and through the following day, Schedule-M&#10;&gt; worked flawlessly. The new day process was last measured taking less&#10;&gt; than&#10;&gt; five minutes for 960 jobs and we approximated job volumes 14,500 per&#10;&gt; day.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; This demonstrates the reliability and scalability of Control-M when&#10;&gt; installed properly.

Solution was to increase the Oracle DB from 50mg&#10;&gt; to&#10;&gt; &gt; 300mg. Also the log &amp; stat files were extremely small. These files&#10;&gt; were&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaned out by Rusty, however were never increased or set to truncate&#10;&gt; in&#10;&gt; &gt; Oracle. They will fill up again. These files need to be set to&#10;&gt; truncate&#10;&gt; &gt; by the Oracle DBA or run a set of daily utilities to clean those&#10;&gt; files.&#10;&gt; &gt; We will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the&#10;&gt; daily&#10;&gt; &gt; schedule.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Issue number 2 - According to a diagnostic report the agent machine&#10;&gt; lost&#10;&gt; &gt; connection with the NIS server for a greater period of time than what&#10;&gt; the&#10;&gt; &gt; default settings were set. The agent is set to retry every 120&#10;&gt; seconds up&#10;&gt; &gt; to 12 times. After this period, manual activation is required. I&#10;&gt; signed&#10;&gt; &gt; on as CTMAGENT user and ran ag_menu. Ran option 2 which showed the&#10;&gt; NIS as&#10;&gt; &gt; down. I then signed on as the Control-M user and ran ctm_menu.&#10;&gt; Selected&#10;&gt; &gt; 7 - Agent Status, Selected 2 - List all agent platforms unavailable.&#10;&gt; &gt; Agent on BMC was in unavailable status. Next Selected option 3 -&#10;&gt; Change&#10;&gt; &gt; agent platform to Available status. After doing that, all the jobs&#10;&gt; turned&#10;&gt; &gt; to gray status and started running.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Cleaned up 2 erroneous agent names defined to Control-M/Server.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; I also ran a Trouble Shooting Report which produced a file&#10;&gt; &gt; (/var/home/ctlm00/report.1116001128) from this file we could tell&#10;&gt; when&#10;&gt; &gt; the Log filed filled up and when the Agent stopped.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; I set up 500 jobs to run daily on BMC with multiple dependencies.&#10;&gt; All&#10;&gt; ran&#10;&gt; &gt; ok.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; I set up aprox. another 150 cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on&#10;&gt; &gt; OCSDEV-1. They failed due to not using the correct Owner. Rusty&#10;&gt; knows&#10;&gt; &gt; what the correct owner should be. I believed I used CTLM00.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; New Day process ran for approx. 12 mins.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Right before leaving Rusty ran a clean_db script, which resulted in&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaning out the entire database. Fortunately by design, we were&#10;&gt; able&#10;&gt; to&#10;&gt; &gt; demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ECS to&#10;&gt; the&#10;&gt; &gt; Control-M Server. In less than 5 minutes all was ok.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; When I left there were approx. 900 jobs running. Of those approx.&#10;&gt; 400&#10;&gt; &gt; jobs were running cyclic, every 2 minutes. Which meant on a daily&#10;&gt; basis&#10;&gt; &gt; approx. 14,500 jobs ran per day.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Larry, I know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations.&#10;&gt; These&#10;&gt; &gt; is something that's very subjective. As with almost any software the&#10;&gt; more&#10;&gt; &gt; memory and faster CPU the better. To do this correctly, we should&#10;&gt; have&#10;&gt; &gt; our Professional Services come in and do some type of assessment of&#10;&gt; your&#10;&gt; &gt; environment and the direction your heading. How many jobs per day,&#10;&gt; today,&#10;&gt; &gt; near future, etc.... How many Users of ECS? How many Servers?&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; In your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without&#10;&gt; a&#10;&gt; &gt; major problem. Your ECS NT box is on the small size, at least in the&#10;&gt; &gt; memory area. So your responses might not be as fast as desired.&#10;&gt; Please&#10;&gt; &gt; remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a&#10;&gt; large&#10;&gt; &gt; number of jobs. Therefore database tuning is always recommended.&#10;&gt; These&#10;&gt; &gt; tuning recommendations are provided by Professional Services.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; By tomorrow I will send you the daily utilities.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Thanks,&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Ronnie Sapp&#10;&gt; &gt; bmcsoftware&#10;&gt; &gt; INCONTROL Business Unit&#10;&gt; &gt; Software Consultant Manager&#10;&gt; &gt; West Region&#10;&gt; &gt; 972-934-5065&#10;&gt; &gt; ronnie_sapp@bmc.com&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; - C.DTF &lt;&lt; File: C.DTF &gt;&gt;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

There is a process &#10;that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with &#10;existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it &#10;is for a small subset of the population. Furthermore, all applications must &#10;be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the &#10;desktops. As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to &#10;install the application itself.&#10;&#10;Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting? It is installed &#10;with IE5 and provides real time chat.&#10;&#10;I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at &#10;this time.&#10;&#10;Regards,&#10;&#10;-jkc&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Brian Hoskins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS&#10;10/23/2000 01:25 PM&#10;To: John Cheng/NA/Enron@Enron&#10;cc: Fangming Zhu/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pablo Torres/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Don &#10;Adam/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marlin Gubser/HOU/ECT@ECT &#10;Subject: &#10;&#10;John,&#10;&#10;I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with &#10;IE 5.0.

Things are going crazy in the gas market so, &#10;unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews. &#10;&#10;As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. &#10;Be confident. Answer the question asked. Don't be afraid to say you don't &#10;know but don't make excuses. Express interest in why you find Enron &#10;appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing. &#10;&#10;The trading training program is still in the works. Few people outside the &#10;trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask &#10;any questions about it in the interviews. If you receive an offer, it would &#10;probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the &#10;training program when you arrive. Not sure about that last statement &#10;though. The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure &#10;trading business areas: gas and power. There are still a large number of &#10;other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall &#10;under the program. That's a function of the program being developed by the &#10;head of these two businesses. Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.&#10;&#10;Write me about how your interviews went.&#10;Good luck:&#10;John&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"Adam Bayer" &lt;adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu&gt; on 10/19/2000 03:28:57 PM&#10;To: &lt;john.arnold@enron.com&gt;&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: How are you today&#10;&#10;&#10;Hi John,&#10;&#10;How are you today?

We specialize in assisting foreign national&#10;&gt; corporations with regard to their real estate interest in&#10;&gt; Mexico.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Currently our M,xico City office is representing a client&#10; regarding the disposition of their surplus corporate assets in&#10;country.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; They have three properties which may be might be of&#10;&gt; interest.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; 1. Light to Heavy Industrial building in Tula, Hidalgo (a&#10;&gt; well-populated industrial valley roughly 50 miles north of&#10;&gt; Mexico City). Deluxe all brick and concrete building is&#10;&gt; approximately 98,500 square feet with clear span ceiling&#10;&gt; height in excess of 30 ft. The site includes adjacent land,&#10;&gt; which would allow more than doubling the size of facility.&#10;&gt; Located in front of the PEMEX Hidalgo refinery /&#10;&gt; petrochemical plant and a Thermoelectric power generating&#10;&gt; station. Factory is equipment ready and could be in full&#10;&gt; production quickly.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; 2. Housing complex built for the Tula factory supervisory&#10;&gt; personnel consists of 32 three-bedroom garden style&#10;&gt; townhouse apartments and an independent eight bedroom&#10;&gt; extended stay dormitory for engineers. In a separately&#10;&gt; enclosed compound is a 3,800 square foot deluxe residence&#10;&gt; with 4-car garage designed for the plant manager or visiting&#10;&gt; officials. The property contains appropriate recreational&#10;&gt; and sports areas for families. It is entirely gated and&#10;&gt; fully secured.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; 3. Development site City of Puebla. This highly visible 8.7&#10;&gt; acres of flat land fronts the Puebla-Mexico City&#10;&gt; superhighway at a formal exit. It is at the entrance corner&#10;&gt; to an industrial area of other trans-national manufactures.&#10;&gt; Site is located approximately 5.5 miles north of the&#10;&gt; Volkswagen assembly plant.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Prefer selling items 1 &amp; 2 as a package, but will entertain&#10;&gt; separate offers. Would also consider long term lease with a&#10;&gt; creditworthy corporate tenant.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; With respect to item 3, a build to suit, again a&#10;&gt; long-term lease with a credit worthy corporate tenant is&#10;&gt; possible.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; All properties are surplus assets and therefore very&#10;&gt; aggressively priced. Factory and housing offered at&#10;&gt; substantially below replacement cost.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; For more information on these items and other services we&#10;&gt; provide in Mexico please visit our web site.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; http://www.MIHC.com.mx&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; In the US:&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rick Curry&#10;&gt; General Counsel&#10;&gt; MIHC - Los Angeles&#10;&gt; PH 213-308-0300&#10;&gt; email to: RGCurry@MIHC.com.mx&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; In Mexico:&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Ari Feldman, CCIM, SIOR, CIPS&#10;&gt; Director General&#10;&gt; MIHC - Mexico City&#10;&gt; Phone from the US (011) (52) 5286-3458&#10;&gt; email to: AFeldman@MIHC.com.mx&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the&#10;signed contract is "on the way".&#10;&#10;The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to&#10;provide/supply natural gas to our company. We consume quite a bit of&#10;natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace. I believe last&#10;year we spent about $500,000.&#10;&#10;As we both know the price of natural gas is rising. It never hurts to check&#10;and see if better deals are out there. If this is of any interest, please&#10;pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle. The can contact&#10;me first and then I will turn over to our person here.

If Larry and Everett &#10;can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in &#10;for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.&#10;&#10;Larry,&#10;&#10;I have left you a voicemail, and this note.

Thank you. &#10;&#10;&#10;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip: the first day (only) &#10;is for executives to investigate the following items --&#10;1) what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal &#10;use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.) EBS sell &#10;EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use&#10;2) ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into &#10;a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type &#10;of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined. EBS sell with, &#10;and/or through the Avaya sales organization&#10;&#10;&#10;The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS &#10;development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: &#10;1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&amp;2 above, &#10;discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues &#10;and opportunities&#10;and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which &#10;could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions &#10; to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &amp; &#10;marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both &#10;days due to the nature of his mission.&#10;&#10;&#10;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;Please let me know as soon as you can which day or &#10;days would work best for you to make the trip. I need to &#10;get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so &#10;he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing &#10;center facility.&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716&#10;----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 11/21/2000 03:56 PM -----&#10;&#10; Jeff Youngflesh&#10; 11/21/2000 10:44 AM&#10; &#10; To: thadwhite@avaya.com&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: RE: Enron / Avaya meetings in Basking Ridge&#10;&#10;Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the &#10;people scheduled?

I assume it is the former, not the &#10;latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the &#10;latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't &#10;matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the &#10;average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let &#10;me know.&#10;&#10;Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the &#10;settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD. &#10;SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to &#10;argue for one or the other.&#10;&#10;Regards,&#10;Gary&#10;x31511&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

I assume it is the former, not the &#10;latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the &#10;latter?

The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly &#10;identical product. The fight is over which execution model is superior. I &#10;would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct. It's &#10;happened in Europe already. The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the &#10;LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry. Within weeks, &#10;the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I &#10;still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals &#10;and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. &#10;The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. &#10;It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address. &#10;John&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"Bayer, Adam Ryan" &lt;adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu&gt; on 10/03/2000 01:23:01 PM&#10;To: John.Arnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: Thank you for dinner last night&#10;&#10;&#10;Dear Mr. Arnold,&#10;&#10; It was nice to meet you yesterday at the&#10;information session. Thank you for the dinner last night.&#10;I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in&#10;a more relaxed setting.&#10;&#10; During out conversation yesterday, I was confused&#10;about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of&#10;your time on the phone with Traders in New York. When&#10;you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards&#10;Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron&#10;Online? I think the underlying question that I am asking,&#10;is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,&#10;or is it meant to bypass traders completely.&#10;&#10;Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward&#10;to talking with you again when you come to campus for&#10;interviews.&#10;&#10;Cordially,&#10;&#10;Adam&#10;-----------------------------------------------------------------&#10;Bayer, Adam Ryan&#10;Vanderbilt University&#10;Email: adam.r.bayer@Vanderbilt.Edu&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

Any drop under today's lows is a negative &#10;for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type of strength &#10;pattern today.? It is not a "9" type topping pattern, but one that normally &#10;comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would suggest a &#10;potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major &#10;importance.&#10;?&#10;I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October 19.?

We want the orders open as long as possible. &#10;Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. &#10;Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading &#10;session unless specified otherwise. &#10;&#10;2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. &#10;When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 &#10;increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the &#10;quantity to be 15,000. &#10;&#10;3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system &#10;saying error trade, price not available.&#10;&#10;4. Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, &#10;without canceling it and resubmitting a new one? If not, this would be a &#10;valuable feature.&#10;&#10;Thx,&#10;John</body></mail>&#10;</mail>

MG clears their own trades and &#10;maybe some for other customers. He indicated that his cost for clearing is &#10;$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing &#10;ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher &#10;clearing rate and getting access to financing. This is a question I hope &#10;your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer. &#10;&#10;Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El &#10;Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long &#10;futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin &#10;costs. </body></mail>&#10;</mail>
